## Introduction

After completing the Backend and the Video Processing Pipeline, the next step is to test the entire system to ensure that all components are correctly integrated. The testing process follows the complete workflow, from user authentication and video upload to automatic video processing and playback on the web application.

The test results are used to verify the functionality, stability, and reliability of the serverless architecture.

## Objectives

After this section, the system should be able to:

- Authenticate users successfully.
- Upload videos to Amazon S3.
- Trigger the processing pipeline automatically.
- Update video metadata correctly.
- Play processed videos on the web application.

## Result

The uploaded video is stored in the Raw Upload Bucket, and the processing pipeline starts automatically.

# Test Video List

## Procedure

After the MediaConvert job is completed, open the video list page to verify that the uploaded video is displayed.

*Figure 5.26. Video list page.*

## Result

The application correctly displays the video metadata and processing status.

---

# Test Video Playback

## Procedure

Select a processed video from the list and play it directly in the browser.

*Figure 5.27. Video playback page.*

## Result

The video is streamed successfully using HLS files stored in Amazon S3 and delivered through Amazon CloudFront.

---

# Verify the Dashboard

## Procedure

Open the system dashboard to review video information and processing status.

*Figure 5.28. System dashboard.*

## Result

The dashboard displays accurate information about uploaded videos and their processing status.

## Summary

The testing results confirm that the system functions as expected. Users can sign in, upload videos, monitor processing progress, and stream processed videos through the web application. All AWS services operate together successfully, demonstrating that the **Serverless Video-on-Demand Platform on AWS** has been implemented correctly.
